version 0.1.11 (31-March-2007):
	* Fix a typo in SexyUrlLabel that was causing the widget to never be
	  marked as unmapped, which prevented it from re-mapping the event
	  window when the widget was shown again. (Bugs #364030 and #353946)
	* Fixed the cursors to properly indicate whether the text was selectable.
	* Get rid of the unused SexyTooltipPriv structure to fix building on
	  Solaris. (Bug #378066)
	* Remove some debug output from SexyIconEntry and SexyTreeView.
	  (Bug #355129)

version 0.1.10 (5-September-2006):
	* Fixed a crasher when calling sexy_icon_entry_set_icon() before the
	  widget is realized. (Bug #354149)

version 0.1.9 (2-September-2006):
	* Fixed a bug where the cursor position in a SexySpellEntry would change
	  if the position was at the end of the entry and word was replaced.
	* Fixed a few enchant-related bugs in SexySpellEntry.
	* Fixed our GModule loading for enchant to let glib figure out the
	  proper file extension, rather than hard-coding ".so".
	* Fixed some uninitialized variables when creating the icon windows for
	  SexyIconEntry that were causing valgrind to complain. Patch by
	  Benjamin Otte. (Bug #349701)
	* Fixed a bug in SexyIconEntry where the caret would be invisible at
	  the start of the entry when no icon was shown. Patch by Ed Catmur.
	  (Bug #353671)
	* Fixed a bug with SexyToolTip positioning in treeviews without headers
	  where the tooltips would immediately disappear when shown at the
	  bottom of the screen. (Bug #333424)
	* Fixed a linking bug when building on win32. Patch by Steffen
	  Eschenbacher. (Bug #351796)

version 0.1.8 (18-March-2006):
	* Fixed compilation on gcc 2.95. Patch by Jens Granseuer. (Bug #334784)
	* Fixed the type-punned pointer warning when grabbing symbols from
	  libenchant.
	* Fixed to try to open libenchant.so.1 before trying libenchant.so.
	  This allows people to use spell checking without requiring the devel
	  package on most distros.

version 0.1.7 (15-March-2006):
	* Fixed some final licensing issues with the iso-codes.
	* Fixed selectable text in SexyUrlLabel. This fixes bug #329441.
	* Fixed spell checking on words in SexySpellEntry that contain wide
	  characters. (Bug #325684)
	* Fixed SexySpellEntry to only check for spelling if one or more
	  dictionaries are loaded. (Bug #330733)
	* Fixed SexySpellEntry to only activate languages from $LANGUAGE
	  that enchant thinks it has a dictionary for. This prevents a
	  discrepancy between the active languages and the list of languages
	  that SexySpellEntry reports as having dictionaries.
	  (Bugs #331666, #331669)
	* Fixed a potential crash in sexy_spell_entry_set_checked(). (Bug #331196)
	* Fixed potential crashes when certain SexySpellEntry functions were
	  called when no text was entered. (Bug #331325)
	* Added sexy_spell_entry_set_languages(). (Bug #329846)
	* Added sexy_spell_entry_get_active_languages(). (Bug #331340)
	* Added sexy_spell_entry_activate_default_languages(). (Bug #331778)
	* Renamed sexy_spell_entry_set_languages() to
	  sexy_spell_entry_set_active_languages().

	* Added API for disabling spell checking in SexySpellEntry.
	* Added a SexyTooltip widget for providing custom widget content in
	  a tooltip look-alike.

	* Fixed some small bugs involving widget alllocation and requisition and
	  and such in SexyUrlLabel.
	* Fixed some C99 compilation issues.
	* Fixed some copyright headers that were specifying the wrong license.
	* Require a newer version of iso-codes in order to fix a possible
	  licensing issue.
	* Improved the documentation.

version 0.1.5 (24-December-2005):
	* Made Enchant into a run-time dependency.
	* Fixed a reference issue when assigning an icon to a SexyIconEntry.
	  In bindings like the Python bindings, where a garbage collector exists,
	  the lack of referencing the icon was causing crashes.
	* Fixed a couple of crash bugs in populate_popup in SexySpellEntry,
	  such as when there are no words in the entry.
	* Fixed a few memory leaks.

version 0.1.4 (9-November-2005):

version 0.1.3 (14-October-2005):
	* Fixed several bugs in SexyIconEntry.
	* Added support for icons on both sides of a SexyIconEntry.
	* UrlLabel can now wrap to any width, thanks to the logic in libview.
	* Fixed several other bugs.

version 0.1.2 (22-July-2005):
	* Added SexySpellEntry, a GtkEntry subclass that provides inline
	  spell checking.

version 0.1.1 (14-July-2005):
	* Escaped text is now passed through as escaped in
	  sexy_url_label_set_markup() so that the underlying GtkLabel doesn't
	  get invalid markup.
	* Prevent pango warnings in sexy_url_label_set_markup() when the
	  attribute list is NULL.

version 0.1.0 (13-July-2005):
	* Initial release.
